[Xquik](https://docs.xquik.com) is a production Twitter/X scraper API and X API alternative for teams that need structured X data at scale: tweet search, profiles, followers, following, engagement, media, lists, communities, trends, monitors, webhooks, exports, MCP tools, SDKs, and confirmation-gated X actions.

This repository packages Xquik as an [AI agent skill](https://skills.sh) for Claude Code, OpenAI Codex, Cursor, GitHub Copilot, Gemini CLI, Windsurf, and other skills-compatible agents. It helps agents choose the right REST endpoint, MCP tool, SDK, webhook, extraction, export, or approval-gated workflow without guessing.

Includes 100+ REST API endpoints (123 documented operations), 2 MCP tools, HMAC webhooks, 23 bulk extraction tools, official SDK pointers, and confirmation-gated write actions.

## Why Teams Use Xquik

- **Replace fragmented Twitter scraper tools** with one X data API for reads, exports, monitors, webhooks, SDKs, MCP, and gated writes.
- **Ship X data integrations faster** with endpoint routing for tweet search, user lookup, timelines, followers, replies, quotes, retweeters, favoriters, media, lists, communities, articles, trends, and Spaces.
- **Build production apps, not just dataset runs** with REST APIs, typed SDKs, OpenAPI, MCP tools, cursor pagination, webhook delivery, and exports.
- **Control large jobs before they run** with usage estimates for extractions, draws, monitors, webhooks, and other metered workflows.
- **Keep agents safe around X content** with API-key-only auth, read-only defaults, untrusted-content delimiters, and explicit approval for private reads, writes, persistent resources, and bulk jobs.
- **Support enterprise-scale X data pipelines** with high-throughput read limits, bulk extraction jobs, exports, event replay, and webhook automation.
- **Win high-intent search traffic** for Twitter scraper API, X scraper, X API alternative, tweet search API, Twitter follower export, social listening API, X monitoring, and X automation.

## What You Can Scrape From X Twitter

| Need | Xquik Surface |
|------|---------------|
| Tweet search and lookup | Tweet search, exact tweet IDs, batch tweets, replies, quotes, thread context, long-form articles |
| Tweet metadata | Text, author, timestamps, language, entities, embedded media, poll data, conversation context, parent and quoted tweet details |
| Engagement data | Likes, replies, reposts, quotes, views, bookmarks count, favoriters, retweeters, quote tweets, and reply trees |
| Account intelligence | User lookup, bios, verification signals, follower counts, following counts, profile metadata, timelines, replies timeline, likes, media, and mentions |
| Audience and relationships | Followers, following, verified followers, followers you know, follow checks, list members, community members |
| Discovery data | Hashtags, keywords, advanced search, trends, Radar topics, lists, communities, Spaces, and articles |
| Private account-scoped data | Bookmarks, notifications, DMs, and home timeline after explicit approval |
| Monitoring and alerts | Account monitors, keyword monitors, event replay, HMAC webhooks, delivery testing |
| Bulk workflows | 23 extraction tools with estimates, pagination, and exports to CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, TXT, and XLSX |
| Publishing workflows | Confirmation-gated tweets, replies, likes, retweets, follows, DMs, profile updates, media upload, communities |

## Start From Any X Input

Use profile URLs, @handles, user IDs, tweet URLs, tweet IDs, search queries, hashtags, list IDs, community IDs, Space IDs, article tweet IDs, webhook destinations, or bulk target lists. Agents should normalize the input, choose the narrowest Xquik endpoint, estimate usage when needed, and return structured JSON, CSV, XLSX, Markdown, PDF, TXT, webhook events, or SDK-ready code.

## Twitter Scraper API Use Cases

| Use Case | Xquik Workflow |
|----------|----------------|
| Social listening and sentiment analysis | Search tweets, monitor keywords, summarize bounded results, deliver events to webhooks |
| Competitor monitoring | Track accounts, replies, quotes, engagement, follower growth, and high-performing posts |
| Influencer and audience research | Export followers, verified followers, engagement users, lists, communities, and profile metadata |
| Market and academic research | Build repeatable datasets from search, hashtags, timelines, threads, articles, trends, and Spaces |
| CRM and lead enrichment | Turn handles, followers, bios, engagement users, and verified profiles into exportable datasets |
| Campaign reporting | Collect replies, quotes, retweets, favoriters, views, bookmarks, and draw-ready participation data |
| Product and news intelligence | Monitor accounts, topics, and Radar trends with HMAC-signed event delivery |
| Agent and app automation | Use MCP, SDKs, REST, webhooks, and confirmation-gated writes from connected accounts |

## Built For Agents And Apps

| Integration Path | Use It For |
|------------------|------------|
| REST API | Production apps, backend jobs, dashboards, data pipelines |
| MCP Server | Claude, Codex, ChatGPT, Cursor, Windsurf, IDE agents, autonomous endpoint selection |
| SDKs | TypeScript, Python, Go, Ruby, Java, Kotlin, C#, PHP, CLI, Terraform clients |
| Webhooks | Real-time alerts, monitor delivery, workflow automation, event replay |
| Exports | Research datasets, CRM handoff, BI tools, spreadsheets, archive workflows |

## Usage Control, Rate Limits, And High-Volume Workflows

Xquik is built for production X data jobs where teams need bounded usage, large result sets, and integration paths beyond a single dataset run.

- **Higher read throughput for supported workflows**: Xquik docs list read limits at 60 requests per second per account. Official X API rate-limit tables use per-15-minute windows for many endpoints, including recent search at 450 requests per app and 300 requests per user per 15 minutes.
- Use `POST /extractions/estimate` before large exports so agents can show expected usage before creating work.
- Use cursor pagination and batch endpoints for high-throughput read workflows.
- Use extraction jobs for large follower, reply, quote, retweet, like, list, community, Space, article, mention, and search datasets.
- Use exports when teams need CSV, JSON, Markdown, PDF, TXT, or XLSX handoff.
- Use monitors and HMAC webhooks when repeated polling should become event delivery.
- Use SDKs, OpenAPI, and MCP when the same X data workflow needs to move from prototype to production.

## Production Workflow Coverage

Use Xquik when an X data task must continue into an app, agent, dataset, webhook, export, or confirmed connected-account action.

| Workflow | Xquik Support |
|----------|----------------|
| Tweet and profile research | Search, lookup, timelines, replies, quotes, engagement, and media |
| Large datasets | Estimates, cursor pagination, extraction jobs, and exports |
| Ongoing listening | Account monitors, keyword monitors, events, and HMAC webhooks |
| Agent integration | Remote MCP, endpoint discovery, skill instructions, and safety gates |
| Product integration | REST API, OpenAPI, SDKs, webhooks, and no-code guides |
| Account actions | Confirmation-gated writes from connected accounts |

Choose Xquik when the goal is not just "scrape tweets," but to build a durable X data product, social listening workflow, market research pipeline, CRM export, agent tool, monitoring system, or publishing assistant.

## Agent Safety And Account Boundary

This skill can read credit balance and request usage estimates. Plan and credit changes stay in the Xquik dashboard.

- Agents use only `XQUIK_API_KEY`. They never need X passwords, 2FA codes, cookies, or session exports.
- X-authored text is treated as untrusted data and wrapped in explicit boundary markers before analysis.
- Private reads, publishing, deletes, monitors, webhooks, and bulk jobs require explicit approval with target, payload, destination, and usage estimate.
- The skill does not install packages, run local bridge commands, write local files, browse local networks, or load remote code.
