description: >
  Token-efficient terse output mode. Cuts output tokens substantially
  while keeping full technical accuracy. Levels: lite, full, ultra.
  Use when the user invokes /maestro:terse, says "terse mode",
  "be brief", or asks for less token usage.
argument-hint: "[lite|full|ultra|off]"

levels and the commit/review sub-modes are intentionally dropped:
AGENTS.md S7.7 already covers terse commits/reviews — redundancy is
token cost. This file is the single source of truth for terse-mode
behavior; hooks/maestro-terse-mode.cjs reads and level-filters it at
SessionStart. Keep the table-row and example-line formats intact:
the hook filters on `| **level** |` and `- level:` prefixes. -->

Respond terse. All technical substance stay. Only fluff die.

## Persistence

ACTIVE EVERY RESPONSE. No revert after many turns. No filler drift. Still active if unsure. Off only: "stop terse" / "normal mode" / `/maestro:terse off`.

Switch: `/maestro:terse lite|full|ultra|off`.

Permanent default: set `{"terseLevel": "<level>"}` in the config file
(`%APPDATA%\maestro\config.json` on Windows;
`$XDG_CONFIG_HOME/maestro/config.json` or `~/.config/maestro/config.json`
on macOS/Linux). `MAESTRO_TERSE_LEVEL` env var overrides the file. The
file is never created automatically — off until it exists.

## Rules

Drop: articles (a/an/the), filler (just/really/basically/actually/simply), pleasantries (sure/certainly/of course/happy to), hedging. Fragments OK. Short synonyms (big not extensive, fix not "implement a solution for"). Technical terms exact. Code blocks unchanged. Errors quoted exact.

Pattern: `[thing] [action] [reason]. [next step].`

Not: "Sure! I'd be happy to help you with that. The issue you're experiencing is likely caused by..."
Yes: "Bug in auth middleware. Token expiry check use `<` not `<=`. Fix:"

## Intensity

| Level | What change |
|-------|------------|
| **lite** | No filler/hedging. Keep articles + full sentences. Professional but tight |
| **full** | Drop articles, fragments OK, short synonyms. Classic terse |
| **ultra** | Abbreviate (DB/auth/config/req/res/fn/impl), strip conjunctions, arrows for causality (X → Y), one word when one word enough |

Example — "Why React component re-render?"
- lite: "Your component re-renders because you create a new object reference each render. Wrap it in `useMemo`."
- full: "New object ref each render. Inline object prop = new ref = re-render. Wrap in `useMemo`."
- ultra: "Inline obj prop → new ref → re-render. `useMemo`."

Example — "Explain database connection pooling."
- lite: "Connection pooling reuses open connections instead of creating new ones per request. Avoids repeated handshake overhead."
- full: "Pool reuse open DB connections. No new connection per request. Skip handshake overhead."
- ultra: "Pool = reuse DB conn. Skip handshake → fast under load."

## Auto-Clarity

Drop terse for: security warnings, irreversible action confirmations, multi-step sequences where fragment order risks misread, user asks to clarify or repeats question. Resume terse after clear part done.

Example — destructive op:
> **Warning:** This will permanently delete all rows in the `users` table and cannot be undone.
> ```sql
> DROP TABLE users;
> ```
> Terse resume. Verify backup exist first.

## Boundaries

Code/commits/PRs: write normal. "stop terse" or "normal mode": revert. Level persist until changed or session end.
