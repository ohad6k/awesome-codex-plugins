`oc-codex-multi-auth` is an OpenCode plugin for ChatGPT Plus/Pro OAuth, Codex and GPT-5 model routing, multi-account rotation, account switching, health checks, quota visibility, diagnostics, and recovery tools. It installs the OpenCode provider/TUI configuration, registers a `codex-*` command toolkit, and routes OpenCode OpenAI SDK requests through the ChatGPT-backed Codex flow with local account state.

Use it when you want OpenCode to run Codex-style coding workflows from your own ChatGPT subscription while keeping accounts visible, switchable, health-checked, and recoverable from the terminal.

## Why Developers Use It

`oc-codex-multi-auth` makes OpenCode's ChatGPT OAuth state understandable and operable. Instead of treating auth as one opaque provider file, you get a local account pool, deterministic account switching, health-aware request selection, visible quota status, JSON-friendly diagnostics, and safe repair commands for stale or damaged state. The plugin is designed for personal development workflows: credentials stay local, OpenCode keeps owning the host runtime, and the plugin only handles the OAuth-backed Codex routing layer it is installed for.

---

## Current Architecture At A Glance

`oc-codex-multi-auth` ships four user-visible surfaces:

| Surface | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| `oc-codex-multi-auth` | npm installer bin; updates `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, manages `tui.json`, normalizes stale plugin entries, and clears OpenCode plugin cache |
| OpenCode plugin entry (`index.ts`) | auth loader, OAuth login modes, provider fetch pipeline, account rotation, retry/failover, and `codex-*` tool registry |
| OpenCode TUI plugin (`tui.ts`) | prompt quota status, quota details, shared quota cache, and active-account-aware display |
| 21 `codex-*` tools | setup, help, status, list, switch, limits, health, metrics, doctor, dashboard, backup, keychain, diagnostics, and recovery actions |

The plugin does not replace OpenCode. OpenCode remains the host; this package installs provider/TUI config and supplies the OAuth-backed Codex request pipeline that OpenCode calls.

## Installation

<details open>
<summary><b>For Humans</b></summary>

### Option A: Standard install

```bash
npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest
```

### Option B: Full explicit model catalog

Use this when you want direct selector IDs such as `openai/gpt-5.5-medium` in addition to OpenCode variants.

```bash
npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest --full
```

### Option C: Verify wiring

```bash
opencode --version
opencode debug config
opencode auth login
```

The installer updates `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json`, backs up the previous config, normalizes the plugin entry to `"oc-codex-multi-auth"`, enables the TUI status plugin in `~/.config/opencode/tui.json`, and clears the OpenCode cached plugin copy so OpenCode reinstalls the latest package.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>For LLM Agents</b></summary>

### Step-by-step

1. Install or refresh config:
   - `npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest`
2. Run first login flow:
   - `opencode auth login`
3. Validate config:
   - `opencode debug config`
4. Run a smoke request:
   - `opencode run "Explain this repository" --model=openai/gpt-5.5 --variant=medium`
5. Inspect plugin state with the OpenCode tool surface:
   - `codex-status`
   - `codex-doctor`
   - `codex-list`

### Verification

```bash
opencode debug config
opencode auth login
opencode run "ping" --model=openai/gpt-5.5 --variant=medium
```

</details>

---

## Quick Start

Install and sign in:

```bash
npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest
opencode auth login
```

Run a prompt with compact modern selectors:

```bash
opencode run "Summarize the failing test and suggest a fix" --model=openai/gpt-5.5 --variant=medium
opencode run "Summarize the failing test and suggest a fix" --model=openai/gpt-5.5-fast --variant=medium
```

Use Codex-focused routing:

```bash
opencode run "Refactor the retry logic and update the tests" --model=openai/gpt-5-codex --variant=high
```

If browser launch is blocked, use the alternate login paths in [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md#remote-or-headless-login).

## Command Toolkit

### Start here

| Tool | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `codex-setup` | How do I finish first-run setup safely? |
| `codex-help` | Which plugin commands exist and what do they do? |
| `codex-doctor` | What is wrong with auth, config, storage, or routing? |
| `codex-next` | What should I do next to get unstuck? |

### Daily use

| Tool | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `codex-list` | Which accounts are saved and which one is active? |
| `codex-switch` | How do I move to a different saved account? |
| `codex-warm` | How do I start every account's usage window now (stagger quota cooldowns)? |
| `codex-status` | Which account, model family, and routing state are active? |
| `codex-limits` | What quota or rate-limit state is visible now? |
| `codex-reset` | Do I have a banked rate-limit reset credit, and how do I redeem it? |
| `codex-dashboard` | Can I manage accounts from one interactive surface? |

Most of these also run as a **direct CLI** with no agent/model involvement (no token cost) — e.g. `oc-codex-multi-auth warm`, `oc-codex-multi-auth status`, or `npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest warm`. Use `oc-codex-multi-auth warm` to open every enabled account's usage window at the start of a session and stagger the rolling quota cooldowns. Add `--json` for scriptable output.

### Account management

| Tool | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `codex-label` | How do I name an account? |
| `codex-tag` | How do I group accounts with tags? |
| `codex-note` | How do I attach a private note to an account? |
| `codex-remove` | How do I remove a saved account safely? |
| `codex-refresh` | How do I refresh or re-login an account? |

### Diagnostics and backup

| Tool | What it answers |
| --- | --- |
| `codex-health` | Which accounts look healthy, limited, or disabled? |
| `codex-metrics` | What runtime counters and request metrics are visible? |
| `codex-diag` | Can I export a redacted diagnostic snapshot? |
| `codex-diff` | What changed between account/config snapshots? |
| `codex-export` | How do I back up account storage? |
| `codex-import` | How do I restore accounts with a dry-run first? |
| `codex-keychain` | Which credential backend is active and can I migrate it? |

### Reliability behavior

- stateless request handling forces `store: false`
- `reasoning.encrypted_content` is preserved for multi-turn continuity
- account rotation is health-aware and avoids repeatedly selecting cooling accounts
- 5xx bursts, network failures, and quota responses penalize account health
- token refresh is queued to avoid refresh races
- unsupported-model handling is strict by default, with opt-in fallback controls
- TUI quota status follows the account/workspace used by the latest request

## Storage Paths

| File | Default path |
| --- | --- |
| OpenCode config | `~/.config/opencode/opencode.json` |
| OpenCode TUI config | `~/.config/opencode/tui.json` |
| OpenCode auth tokens | `~/.opencode/auth/openai.json` |
| Plugin config | `~/.opencode/openai-codex-auth-config.json` |
| Global account storage | `~/.opencode/oc-codex-multi-auth-accounts.json` |
| Per-project accounts | `~/.opencode/projects/<project-key>/oc-codex-multi-auth-accounts.json` |
| Flagged accounts | `~/.opencode/oc-codex-multi-auth-flagged-accounts.json` |
| Backups | `~/.opencode/backups/` or `~/.opencode/projects/<project-key>/backups/` |
| Logs | `~/.opencode/logs/codex-plugin/` |
| TUI quota cache | OpenCode state path plus `~/.opencode/oc-codex-multi-auth-tui-quota.json` fallback |

Per-project storage is enabled by default. The plugin walks up from the current directory to find a project root, then stores account pools under the project-specific key. If no project root is found, it falls back to global storage.

## Credential Storage

<details open>
<summary><b>Default JSON backend</b></summary>

By default, account pools are stored locally as V3 JSON files. File permissions are restricted where the platform supports them.

Use JSON storage when you want predictable, inspectable local files and easy backup/export behavior.

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Optional OS keychain backend</b></summary>

Set `CODEX_KEYCHAIN=1` to store account pools in the OS keychain instead:

- macOS: Keychain
- Windows: Credential Manager
- Linux: libsecret, with a running secret service such as GNOME Keyring or KWallet

Manage the backend from OpenCode:

```text
codex-keychain status
codex-keychain migrate
codex-keychain rollback
```

If the keychain is unavailable, the plugin logs a warning and falls back to JSON storage for that operation. Credentials are never silently deleted.

</details>

## Troubleshooting

<details open>
<summary><b>60-second recovery</b></summary>

```text
codex-doctor --fix
codex-next
codex-status format="json"
```

If still broken:

```bash
opencode auth login
```

</details>

<details>
<summary><b>Common symptoms</b></summary>

- Plugin does not load: rerun `npx -y oc-codex-multi-auth@latest`, then restart OpenCode
- Config looks wrong: run `opencode debug config` and confirm `"plugin": ["oc-codex-multi-auth"]`
- OAuth callback fails: free port `1455`, then rerun `opencode auth login`
- Browser launch is blocked: use the remote/headless login path from [docs/getting-started.md](docs/getting-started.md#remote-or-headless-login)
- Wrong account is selected: run `codex-list`, then `codex-switch`
- Account pool looks unhealthy: run `codex-health format="json"` and `codex-doctor deep=true format="json"`
- Import/export feels risky: run `codex-import path="..." dryRun=true` before applying
- Debugging model fallback: enable `ENABLE_PLUGIN_REQUEST_LOGGING=1` and inspect `~/.opencode/logs/codex-plugin/`
