When the user mentions an OBD/DTC code and wants to know what it means:

1. Make an HTTP GET request to the CarsXE OBD Codes Decoder API:
   ```
   GET https://api.carsxe.com/obdcodesdecoder?key={CARSXE_API_KEY}&code={CODE}&source=codex_plugin
   ```
2. Present the decoded fault clearly: code, description, system affected, possible causes, and suggested fixes.
3. Add context on severity — whether it requires immediate attention or can wait.
4. If the API key is missing, tell the user to set the `CARSXE_API_KEY` environment variable (see AGENTS.md).
