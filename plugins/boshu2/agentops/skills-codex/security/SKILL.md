# Security Skill

> **Purpose:** Run repeatable security checks across code, scripts, authorized binaries, and repo-managed prompt surfaces.

Use this skill for a caller-requested repository scan, authorized binary assurance, dependency risk, secrets, or offline prompt-surface redteam.

## Critical Constraints

- Scan only repositories, binaries, and prompt surfaces the operator owns or is explicitly authorized to assess. **Why:** a security review does not grant access to third-party systems or proprietary material.
- Keep collection read-only by default; do not exfiltrate secrets, execute destructive payloads, or mutate policy/baselines to manufacture green. **Why:** the assessment must not become the incident or erase its evidence.
- Treat missing/error scanners as a coverage gap, never a clean finding; use `--require-tools` when complete tool coverage is required. **Why:** absent evidence is not evidence of absence.
- Use the current agent and local shell; do not start another runtime or orchestration substrate unless explicitly requested. **Why:** repository scanning is a bounded operation, not permission to fan out.
- Run the selected scan once and report findings plus coverage gaps. Remediation,
  risk acceptance, reruns, and promotion are caller decisions.

## Security Surfaces

1. **Repository gate:** `scripts/security-gate.sh` composes available scanners for quick/full/release checks.
2. **Composable suite:** `scripts/security_suite.py` provides static, dynamic, contract, baseline, and policy primitives for authorized binaries.
3. **Offline redteam:** `scripts/prompt_redteam.py` checks repo-owned prompt and tool-control surfaces against the attack pack.

This is the canonical security runbook. Suite policy gating produces machine-consumable outputs, including `policy/policy-verdict.json` when a policy file is supplied.

Read [the suite runbook](references/security-suite-runbook.md) before binary, policy, baseline, or redteam work. Use [the OWASP checklist](references/owasp-checklist.md) for code-level review.

## Execution Workflow

### 1) Quick gate

Run:

```bash
scripts/security-gate.sh --mode quick
```

**Checkpoint:** preserve the exit code and verify the reported `security-gate-summary.json` exists and parses before triage.

### 2) Full scan

Run:

```bash
scripts/security-gate.sh --mode full
```

Add `--require-tools` when skipped scanners would invalidate the assurance claim. **Checkpoint:** report the result as incomplete unless the selected artifact validator and process both succeed.

### 3) Scheduled gate

Scheduled automation runs the full gate against the intended branch and retains its artifact directory. A failing scheduled run creates actionable tracked work; AgentOps itself does not supply the scheduler.

### 4) Triage

1. Open the latest artifact and identify scanner, severity, file, and coverage gaps.
2. Reproduce the finding with the narrowest safe command.
3. Rank concrete findings and preserve coverage gaps.
4. Stop. Remediation, risk acceptance, and any later scan are new caller decisions. Do not downgrade, suppress, or update a baseline merely to pass.

## Output Specification

**Artifact directory:** repository gates write `${SECURITY_GATE_OUTPUT_DIR:-${TMPDIR:-/tmp}/agentops-security}/<run-id>/`; composable-suite and redteam runs use their explicit `--out-dir`.

**Filename convention:** repository gates require `security-gate-summary.json` (and raw `summary.json`); suite runs require `suite-summary.json`; redteam runs require `redteam/redteam-results.json`.

**Serialization/schema format:** `security-gate-summary.json` is JSON with nonempty `mode`, `run_id`, `output_dir`, and `gate_status`, numeric `missing_tool_count`, boolean `require_tools`, and object `toolchain`.

**Validator command:** with `OUT=<security-gate-run-dir>`, run `jq -e '(.mode|type)=="string" and (.mode|length)>0 and (.run_id|type)=="string" and (.run_id|length)>0 and (.output_dir|type)=="string" and (.output_dir|length)>0 and .gate_status=="PASS" and (.missing_tool_count|type)=="number" and (.require_tools|type)=="boolean" and (.toolchain|type)=="object"' "$OUT/security-gate-summary.json" >/dev/null`.

**Output:** report the artifact path, command/exit code, mode, gate status,
missing-tool coverage, ranked findings, and authorization boundary. Do not add
an owner, next action, approval, release, or retry decision.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Target and authorization boundary are explicit; collection stayed within them.
- [ ] Scanner availability and skipped/error coverage are visible in the report.
- [ ] Findings include severity, location, reproducible evidence, and bounded remediation guidance.
- [ ] Artifacts contain no newly exposed secrets or unredacted sensitive payloads.
- [ ] The report distinguishes a passing scan from permission to promote or release.
- [ ] Suppressions, policy changes, baselines, and risk acceptance require explicit judgment.
- [ ] The report stops after evidence and contains no continuation decision.

## Validation

Run the skill and redteam validators:

```bash
bash skills/security/scripts/validate.sh
bash tests/scripts/test-security-suite-redteam.sh
```

For a bounded suite smoke test, use an owned binary and a temporary output directory as shown in [the suite runbook](references/security-suite-runbook.md).

## Examples

- `$security` — run the quick repository gate, validate its summary, and report coverage/findings.
- `$security --full` — run the full scan once, preserve artifacts, and report coverage and findings.
- `$security run --binary "$(command -v ao)" --out-dir .tmp/security-suite/ao-current` — capture an authorized binary baseline via the composable suite.
- `$security collect-redteam --repo-root .` — run the offline attack pack over repo-owned control surfaces.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Scanner missing/error | Record the coverage gap; install it or rerun with `--require-tools` when required |
| Local/CI mismatch | Compare scanner versions, config, mode, and both artifact directories |
| Suspected false positive | Reproduce narrowly; document any authorized suppression and its owner |
| Suite/baseline failure | Inspect the named compare/policy artifact; never refresh baseline reflexively |
| Redteam failure after wording change | Decide whether the control regressed or the attack-pack matcher needs intentional revision |
