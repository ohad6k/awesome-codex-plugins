# Phase Skill Isolation Contract

How RPI keeps phase skills (`/discovery`, `/crank`, `/validate`, `/learn`) from
compressing each other's work into one agent context while preserving strict
delegation and operator visibility.

## Declaration vs enforcement

**Declaration.** [`PRODUCT.md`](../../../PRODUCT.md) operational principle #5
(two-tier execution) declares that phase skills own their own phase artifacts,
gates, and internal mechanics. `/rpi` owns the lifecycle objective, phase order,
and persistent governor; phases own no cross-phase retry or helper policy.

**Enforcement.** This document plus
[`scripts/check-skill-isolation.sh`](../../../scripts/check-skill-isolation.sh)
enforce the authored contract by detecting compression patterns in phase-skill
SKILL.md bodies. Runtime isolation is a separate transport concern: when a
runtime supports phase-isolated transport, the orchestrator gives a phase runner
only the lifecycle objective, the bounded execution packet path, and the phase
skill name. The runner executes that declared phase contract and returns only
the phase artifact, verdict, and next action.

**Important distinction.** A subagent, daemon job, or spawned process may be a
transport for a declared skill contract. It must not become a replacement for
the skill. "Run `/discovery` in an isolated phase context" preserves strict
delegation. "Skip `/discovery` and have an agent research/plan directly" is
compression.

The companion [`shared/references/strict-delegation-contract.md`](../../shared/references/strict-delegation-contract.md) gives the human-readable rationale and the canonical anti-pattern catalogue. Read this file for the mechanical contract; read that one for the philosophy.

## Four levers

These are the four mechanical levers available to keep phase contexts bounded.
They are listed in increasing strength, with the recommended posture last.

| Lever | Description | Mechanical strength |
|---|---|---|
| A | Text contract in SKILL.md and this reference | Weak - relies on agent compliance |
| B | Static lint via `scripts/check-skill-isolation.sh` | Medium - catches authored compression |
| C | Artifact-only handoff via `.agents/rpi/execution-packet.json` and phase summaries | Strong - limits what crosses phases |
| D | Phase-isolated skill transport | Strongest - phase context can die after the artifact returns |

**Recommended posture: D with A-C always on.** Layered enforcement keeps the
contract durable when any single lever weakens. Text drifts, lint only sees
source files, artifact handoffs can be overstuffed, and transport can be
implemented incorrectly. Together they preserve the narrow waist: phase skill
contract in, bounded artifact out.

## Compression patterns (what NOT to do)

The lint script (`scripts/check-skill-isolation.sh`) flags the following patterns inside phase-skill SKILL.md bodies (`skills/{rpi,discovery,crank,validation}/SKILL.md`):

1. **Cross-phase first-person verbs.** Phrases like `I will research`, `I will plan`, `I will crank`, `I will validate` (case-insensitive). A phase skill should not describe itself as doing another phase's work.
2. **Inline research vocabulary.** Phrases like `let me grep`, `let me read`, `let me search`, `I'll grep`, `I'll read`, `I'll search` (case-insensitive). These signal that the agent intends to inline research-phase work into the current context instead of delegating.
3. **Phase-skill calling another phase skill.** A `Skill(skill="research")`, `Skill(skill="plan")`, `Skill(skill="crank")`, or `Skill(skill="validate")` callsite inside a phase-skill SKILL.md, **except** for the legitimate orchestration patterns:
   - `/rpi` legitimately orchestrates `discovery`, `crank`, `validate`, and `learn` (this is its core contract). It should NOT call `research` or `plan` directly — those are discovery's sub-skills.
   - `/discovery` legitimately orchestrates `research` and `plan`. It should NOT call `crank` or `validation` — those are downstream phases.
   - `/crank` should NOT call `research`, `plan`, `crank`, or `validation` — phase 2 is sealed.
   - `/validate` should NOT call `research`, `plan`, `crank`, or `validation` — phase 3 is sealed.

### False-positive guard

Citations and reference reads are not compression. The lint explicitly excludes:

- Markdown reference links: `See [research](../research/SKILL.md)` (lines beginning with `See [`).
- Reference document reads: `Read references/foo.md` (lines beginning with `Read ` followed by a path).
- Lines inside fenced code blocks (between triple-backtick fences) — code fences may legitimately quote a `Skill(...)` call as an example without invoking it.

When the lint script needs to evolve, prefer narrowing the trigger over widening the guard — silencing a real compression pattern with an over-broad allowlist defeats the purpose.

## Mechanical enforcement

Three surfaces, layered:

1. **Lint.** [`scripts/check-skill-isolation.sh`](../../../scripts/check-skill-isolation.sh) walks `skills/{rpi,discovery,crank,validation}/SKILL.md` (or any path passed positionally) and exits non-zero on the first compression pattern. Run with `-q` / `--quiet` to suppress diagnostic output and rely on exit code only. The script ships a `--self-test` mode that injects a known violation into a tmpdir and asserts the lint catches it.
2. **Artifact handoff.** [`phase-data-contracts.md`](phase-data-contracts.md) defines the bounded files that may cross phase boundaries. Discovery hands Crank an execution packet, Crank hands Validate a phase summary and changed surfaces, Validate hands Learn an immutable verdict, and Learn hands RPI a bounded observation receipt. Raw reasoning does not cross phases.
3. **Phase-isolated skill transport.** When the runtime can isolate phase execution, RPI should run each phase contract in a fresh phase context and keep the main orchestrator visible. The transport may be a daemon job, a process runner, or a subagent wrapper, but its contract is the same: load the declared phase skill, execute it against the bounded handoff, write the expected artifact, and return only artifact path, verdict, and next action.
