# Complexity Scaling

Automatic complexity detection determines the level of validation ceremony applied to each RPI cycle.

## Classification Table

| Level | Issue Count | Wave Count | Ceremony |
|-------|------------|------------|----------|
| **low** | ≤2 | 1 | quick Premortem plus one fresh independent Validate judge |
| **medium** | 3-6 | 1-2 | quick Premortem plus one fresh independent Validate judge |
| **high** | 7+ OR 3+ waves | any | deep or mixed Premortem/Validate when explicitly selected |

> **Design rationale (2026-02-18):** `--quick` (inline single-agent structured review) catches the same class of bugs as full multi-judge council at ~10% of the token cost. The value of multi-judge consensus scales with stakes, not linearly with issue count. Medium-complexity epics (3-6 issues) don't benefit enough from multi-agent spawning to justify the 5-10x cost multiplier. Full council is reserved for high-stakes work where cross-model disagreement has real ROI.

## Detection

Complexity is auto-detected after plan completes (Phase 2) by examining:
- Issue count: `br children <epic-id> | wc -l`
- Wave count: derived from dependency depth

## Flag Precedence (explicit always wins)

| Flag | Effect |
|------|--------|
| `--fast-path` | Forces `low` regardless of auto-detection |
| `--deep` (passed to /rpi) | Forces `high` regardless of auto-detection |
| No flag | Auto-detect from epic structure |

Existing mandatory Premortem doctrine (3+ issues) still applies regardless of complexity level. Learn and the orchestrator transition do not change with depth.
