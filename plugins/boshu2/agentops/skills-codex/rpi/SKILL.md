# $rpi - Full Lifecycle Orchestrator

> Quick ref: `$discovery` -> `$crank` -> `$validate`, then report.

**Execute this workflow. Do not only describe it.** RPI is autonomous unless
`--interactive` is set. Each slice runs the narrow-waist micro-cycle: acceptance test RED -> green -> refactor-under-green (its own step, never changes a test — the load-bearing quality move; test-first ordering alone is not the lever), then the membrane verdict, then mine lessons back into the next loop. The user touchpoint is after validation, or after a
real blocked state exhausts retries. Read
[references/autonomous-execution.md](references/autonomous-execution.md) when
you need the full autonomy contract.

**`--auto` means *pivot autonomously*, NOT *execute the initial plan to the letter*.** Autonomy is agility, not waterfall: between waves the orchestrator re-plans the remaining work and changes course on its own — refactoring, inserting, dropping, reordering waves as evidence arrives — without the operator saying so (touched only at the terminal objective or a circuit-breaker trip). See [Agile Re-Plan Loop](#agile-re-plan-loop-the-anti-waterfall-rule).

When an external executor fails but the code surface may still be valid, read
[references/codex-executor.md](references/codex-executor.md) and recover through
Codex direct checks before declaring a source-level regression.

## Codex Lifecycle Guard

When this skill runs in Codex hookless mode (`CODEX_THREAD_ID` is set or
`CODEX_INTERNAL_ORIGINATOR_OVERRIDE` is `Codex Desktop`), run:

```bash
ao codex ensure-start 2>/dev/null || true
```

Let `$validate`, `$post-mortem`, or `$handoff` own hookless closeout through
`ao codex ensure-stop`.

## Core Contract

RPI delegates via `$discovery`, `$crank`, `$validate` as **separate skill invocations**.
Keep strict delegation on by default; do not compress phases, replace phase
skills with direct agent spawns, or skip `$validate`. Read
[../shared/references/strict-delegation-contract.md](../shared/references/strict-delegation-contract.md)
for the full anti-compression contract.

When the runtime supports phase isolation, keep `$rpi` visible in the main
session and run each phase contract through isolated transport: phase skill
name in, bounded handoff artifact in, phase artifact/verdict/next action out.
The transport may be a daemon job, process runner, or subagent wrapper, but it
must execute the declared phase skill contract rather than doing phase work
directly. See [references/isolation-contract.md](references/isolation-contract.md).

## Phase Receipt Contract

RPI cannot rely on memory or a final narrative to prove delegated skills ran.
Every execution packet and phase summary MUST carry compact receipts for the
orchestrator and the delegated phase skill. JSON artifacts use canonical skill
slugs without `$` sigils:

```json
{
  "skills_loaded": [
    {"name": "rpi", "reason": "orchestrator"},
    {"name": "discovery", "reason": "phase-1"}
  ],
  "phase_receipts": [
    {
      "phase": "discovery",
      "skill": "discovery",
      "status": "DONE",
      "artifact": ".agents/rpi/phase-1-summary.md"
    }
  ]
}
```

Markdown phase summaries include `## Skill Receipts` with one bullet per
loaded skill, the phase it served, and the artifact/verdict it produced.
Receipts do not replace transcript/runtime proof. They make `$discovery`,
`$crank`, and `$validate` delegation auditable from disk when the transcript is
unavailable and give validation or pre-land review a deterministic surface to
reject missing phase execution.

## Context Density Rule

At every phase boundary, preserve only context that carries intent, boundary,
evidence, decision, constraint, or next action. Omit or link anything else.
The domain entry is `../domain/references/context-density-rule.md`.

RPI owns one lifecycle objective across all phases. Preserve the discovered
`epic_id` when present; otherwise preserve the original goal and execution
packet objective. A child bead or one ready slice is context, not a replacement
objective. `<promise>PARTIAL</promise>` from `$crank` means retry Phase 2 on the
same objective.

Preserve the [Intent-to-Loop Hexagon](../../docs/architecture/intent-to-loop-hexagon.md)
boundary as the objective crosses `shape_intent`, `persist_intent`,
`plan_slices`, `execute_wave`, `validate_acceptance`, and `record_evidence`.

## Route And Classify

1. Create `.agents/rpi/`.
2. Resolve `--from`:
   - default, `research`, `plan`, `pre-mortem`, `brainstorm` -> discovery
   - `implementation` or `crank` -> implementation
   - `validation`, `vibe`, or `post-mortem` -> validation
3. If the input is a bead and `--from` is absent, resolve it with `ao beads exec show`:
   - epic -> implementation with that epic
   - child with parent -> implementation with the parent epic
4. Classify complexity:
   - `fast`: short/simple goal or `--fast-path`
   - `standard`: medium goal or one scope keyword
   - `full`: `--deep`, complex-operation keyword, 2+ scope keywords, or >120 chars
5. Log `RPI mode: rpi-phased (complexity: <level>)`.

Track state compactly:

```text
rpi_state = {
  goal: "<goal string>",
  epic_id: null,
  phase: "<discovery|implementation|validation>",
  complexity: "<fast|standard|full>",
  test_first: <true by default; false only when --no-test-first>,
  cycle: 1,
  verdicts: {}
}
```

## Phase DAG

Enter at the routed phase and run every phase after it.

1. **Discovery:** invoke `$discovery <goal> [--interactive] --complexity=<level>`
   directly or through phase-isolated skill transport.
   On DONE, read `.agents/rpi/execution-packet.json` or the run archive and
   preserve its objective spine. On BLOCKED, stop with the discovery verdict.
2. **Implementation:** invoke `$crank <epic-id>` when the packet has `epic_id`;
   otherwise invoke `$crank .agents/rpi/execution-packet.json`, directly or
   through phase-isolated skill transport. Pass `--test-first` or
   `--no-test-first` through. On DONE, record `ao ratchet record implement
   2>/dev/null || true` and continue. On PARTIAL or BLOCKED, retry the same
   objective up to 3 total attempts. **Before counting a slice/wave as accepted,
   the orchestrator reads the actual diff itself** (scope + claim match) — not
   only the `<promise>DONE</promise>` and evidence JSON. This is the orchestrator's
   own diff-read, distinct from the delegated sub-judges; `$crank` enforces it as
   the anti-green-washing check in Wave Acceptance
   ([crank wave-patterns.md, Step 3.5](../crank/references/wave-patterns.md)).
3. **Validation:** invoke `$validate <epic-id> --complexity=<level>` when an
   epic exists; otherwise invoke `$validate --complexity=<level>`, directly
   or through phase-isolated skill transport. Add `--strict-surfaces` when
   `--quality` is set. On FAIL, extract findings, re-run `$crank` on the same
   objective, then re-run `$validate`, up to 3 total validation attempts. On
   DONE, record `ao ratchet record vibe 2>/dev/null || true`.
4. **Re-plan (mandatory between waves; the loop's hinge).** When the objective
   has remaining waves/slices, do NOT proceed straight to the next one. Run the
   [Agile Re-Plan Loop](#agile-re-plan-loop-the-anti-waterfall-rule): a
   post-mortem/discovery delta over what this wave proved or broke, which MAY
   mutate the remaining plan (refactor / insert / drop / reorder / re-scope)
   before the next wave runs. Under `--auto` this is autonomous. A single
   isolated objective with no remaining waves skips straight to Report.
5. **Report:** summarize phase verdicts, the re-plan deltas taken, and epic
   status using [references/report-template.md](references/report-template.md).
   With `--loop`, restart from discovery on FAIL while `cycle < max_cycles`. With
   `--spawn-next`, read `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl` and suggest the next
   command without invoking it. Before emitting the report, apply the Context
   Density Rule: every line should carry intent, boundary, evidence, decision,
   constraint, or next action.

## Agile Re-Plan Loop (the anti-waterfall rule)

The initial plan is a **hypothesis**; each wave is an experiment whose evidence re-plans the rest. At every wave boundary (and after validation): **reflect** (a bounded `$post-mortem` + `$discovery` re-plan delta over what shipped/broke) → **re-plan the REMAINING waves** (refactor / insert / drop / reorder / re-scope / escalate, persisting the mutated plan so the next wave reads the *current* one) → **proceed**. Under `--auto` this is autonomous, bounded by the run's circuit breakers (budget / attempt cap / oscillation detection) and the ≥5-ship post-mortem checkpoint; the operator is touched only at the terminal objective or a breaker trip. `$crank` and `$validate` surface findings UP for re-planning (never a silent local retry); `$discovery` is the re-plan engine. Anti-patterns: **waterfall**, **retry-not-replan**, **permission-seeking**. **Full detail:** [references/agile-replan-loop.md](references/agile-replan-loop.md).

## Phase Data Contract

The execution packet carries the repo execution profile through
`contract_surfaces`, `done_criteria`, and queue claim/finalize metadata. Keep
the latest alias at `.agents/rpi/execution-packet.json` and read
[references/phase-data-contracts.md](references/phase-data-contracts.md) for
schemas and archive paths.

## Complexity-Scaled Gates

### Pre-mortem
- `complexity == "low"` or `"fast"`: inline review, no spawning (`--quick`)
- `complexity == "medium"` or `"standard"`: inline fast default (`--quick`)
- `complexity == "high"` or `"full"`: full council, 2-judge minimum; max 3 total attempts

### Final Vibe
- `complexity == "low"` or `"fast"`: inline review, no spawning (`--quick`)
- `complexity == "medium"` or `"standard"`: inline fast default (`--quick`)
- `complexity == "high"` or `"full"`: full council, 2-judge minimum; max 3 total attempts

### Post-mortem (STEP 2)
- `complexity == "low"` or `"fast"`: inline review, no spawning (`--quick`)
- `complexity == "medium"` or `"standard"`: inline fast default (`--quick`)
- `complexity == "high"` or `"full"`: full council, 2-judge minimum; max 3 total attempts

## Flags

| Flag | Default | Purpose |
|------|---------|---------|
| `--from=<phase>` | discovery | Start at discovery, implementation, or validation |
| `--interactive` | off | Human gates in discovery/validate |
| `--auto` | on | Fully autonomous default — **pivots between waves on its own** (re-plans remaining work; not a fixed-plan/waterfall executor). See [Agile Re-Plan Loop](#agile-re-plan-loop-the-anti-waterfall-rule) |
| `--loop --max-cycles=<n>` | off / 3 | Iterate when validation fails |
| `--spawn-next` | off | Surface follow-up work after reporting |
| `--test-first` | on | Pass strict-quality preference to `$crank` |
| `--no-test-first` | off | Explicitly opt out of strict-quality |
| `--fast-path` / `--deep` | auto | Force fast or full complexity |
| `--quality` | off | Make validation strict surfaces blocking |
| `--dry-run` / `--no-budget` | off | Report only, or disable phase time budgets |

## Examples

**User says:** `$rpi "add user authentication"`
Run discovery, implementation, validation, then report.

**User says:** `$rpi --from=implementation ag-23k`
Resolve the bead scope, run implementation and validation, then report.

**User says:** `$rpi --deep "refactor payment module"`
Use full council gates across the lifecycle.

Read [references/examples.md](references/examples.md) for resume,
interactive, and loop examples.

## Output Specification

**Format:** a markdown report to stdout ([report-template](references/report-template.md)) — phase verdicts, re-plan deltas, and epic status.
**Files:** reads/updates `.agents/rpi/execution-packet.json` (+ `runs/<id>/`) and `.agents/rpi/next-work.jsonl` (with `--spawn-next`); records `ao ratchet record` per phase.
**Exit signal:** the per-phase verdict roll-up; `<promise>PARTIAL</promise>` from `$crank` means retry Phase 2 on the same objective.

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Response |
|---------|----------|
| Discovery BLOCKED | Stop and report discovery's manual-intervention reason |
| `$crank` returns PARTIAL | Retry `$crank` on the same objective; do not narrow to a child slice |
| Validation FAIL | Re-crank with findings, then re-validate, up to 3 total attempts |
| Packet shape unclear | Read [references/phase-data-contracts.md](references/phase-data-contracts.md) |
| External executor fails | Read [references/codex-executor.md](references/codex-executor.md), run direct Codex validation, and only create follow-up work for reproducible source failures |
