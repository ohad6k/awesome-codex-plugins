# $scope — Edit Scope Guard

> **Purpose:** Declare which directories are in scope for the current work session. Edits outside the declared scope are hard-blocked by a PreToolUse hook.

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THIS WORKFLOW. Do not just describe it.**

## Critical Constraints

- Treat `.agents/scope.lock` as a containment boundary, never as permission to edit every path it names. **Why:** scope limits authority; it does not create authority or ownership.
- Resolve each frozen directory repo-relative, reject traversal outside the repository, and verify `ao scope status --json` after every mutation. **Why:** an unverified or escaping prefix gives false confidence about the active boundary.
- Never unfreeze or widen scope merely to make a blocked edit pass; require explicit scope-expansion judgment tied to the original objective. **Why:** silently moving the boundary defeats the guard.
- Use the current agent and local shell for freeze, status, and recovery; do not start another runtime or orchestration substrate unless explicitly requested. **Why:** a path guard does not authorize fan-out.
- `WARN|FAIL|REFUTED -> AUTO-REDO`: consult the pawl, repair the path or lock state, and retry within the same declared scope. **Why:** malformed inputs and failed checks are recovery evidence, not an andon by themselves.
- `BREAKER -> HOLD -> ONE-HELPER`; `HELPER-UNSTUCK -> AUTO-REDO`. On an out-of-scope rejection, hold the write and use one bounded local-shell helper to inspect status and find an in-scope route. **Why:** one recovery pass preserves containment without hiding a real scope conflict.
- `HELPER-ESCALATE -> HUMAN`; `REFUSAL-LANE|EXPLICIT-JUDGMENT|EXHAUSTED-BUDGET -> HUMAN`. **Why:** only a genuine boundary change, unavailable authority, explicit judgment, or exhausted recovery earns the human andon.

## Quick Start

```bash
$scope freeze cli/cmd/ao/                   # Freeze a single directory
$scope freeze cli/cmd/ao/ skills/scope/     # Freeze multiple (additive)
$scope unfreeze cli/cmd/ao/                 # Remove one frozen directory
$scope unfreeze                             # Clear ALL frozen directories
$scope status                               # Show current lock state
$scope status --json                        # JSON output
```

## Behavior Contract

When `.agents/scope.lock` declares one or more `frozen_dirs`:

- Any `Edit`, `Write`, or `Bash` tool call whose target path is **outside** every frozen directory is **rejected** by `hooks/edit-scope-guard.sh` with a structured stderr reason and a non-zero exit code (Codex converts that into a tool-use refusal).
- Edits to paths **under** any frozen directory are allowed.
- When the lock file is missing OR `frozen_dirs` is empty, the hook short-circuits with exit 0 (no enforcement; allow everything).
- The hook fails **open** on malformed JSON or missing target-path fields — do not block when the input contract is violated. Defensive default protects against harness changes.

The lock file is written via `cli/internal/llmwiki/scope_guard.go:SafeAtomicWrite`, so concurrent `freeze` / `unfreeze` calls converge atomically (last writer wins, never tears).

---

## Subcommands

### `$scope freeze <dir>...`

Append one or more directories to the frozen set. Idempotent; re-freezing an already-frozen directory is a no-op. Updates `acquired_at` (ISO-8601) and `acquired_by` (session id or PID) on every write.

### `$scope unfreeze [<dir>]`

Without arguments, clears the entire frozen set. With one or more directory arguments, removes just those entries. Removing a directory that is not frozen is a no-op.

### `$scope status [--json]`

Print the current lock state. With `--json`, emit a single JSON object matching the schema in [references/lock-file-format.md](references/lock-file-format.md). Without flags, print a human-readable summary including each frozen directory, the acquisition timestamp, and the acquiring session.

### `$scope guard` (future combo skill)

Reserved for a follow-up skill that combines `freeze` + status + spawn-orchestration. Not implemented in this release; documented here for forward reference.

---

## Lock File Format

`.agents/scope.lock` is a single JSON object. Full schema lives in [references/lock-file-format.md](references/lock-file-format.md). Key fields:

- `schema_version` — currently `1`
- `frozen_dirs` — list of repo-relative directory prefixes (trailing slash optional)
- `acquired_at` — ISO-8601 UTC timestamp
- `acquired_by` — string identifying the writer (session id, PID, or label)

---

## Output Specification

**Artifact directory:** `.agents/` under the current repository, or the path selected explicitly through `AO_SCOPE_LOCK`/`--lock` for isolated validation.
**Filename convention:** `scope.lock`; status emits the same state to stdout, with `--json` producing one JSON object.
**Serialization/schema format:** JSON matching [lock-file-format](references/lock-file-format.md): `schema_version: 1`, string array `frozen_dirs`, nonempty RFC-3339 `acquired_at`, and string `acquired_by`.
**Validator command:** run `ao scope status --json | jq -e '.schema_version==1 and (.frozen_dirs|type=="array" and all(.[]; type=="string" and length>0)) and (.acquired_at|type=="string" and length>0) and (.acquired_by|type=="string")'`.
**Downstream handoff:** pass the lock path, normalized frozen directories, acquisition identity/time, attempted target, blocked-edit reason, and next safe action to the consuming workflow; a blocked edit enters pawl recovery before scope expansion or human escalation.

## Quality Checklist

- [ ] Every frozen directory is repo-relative, normalized, and tied to the current objective.
- [ ] `ao scope status --json` round-trips after freeze/unfreeze and passes the validator.
- [ ] In-scope and out-of-scope probes demonstrate the intended boundary before risky work.
- [ ] A rejection holds the write and consults the pawl; it never silently widens scope.
- [ ] Unfreeze happens at explicit release/closeout, not as a workaround for a failed command.

## Examples

### Freezing scope before a swarm wave

**User says:** `$scope freeze cli/cmd/ao/ cli/internal/scope/`

**What happens:**

1. `ao scope freeze cli/cmd/ao/ cli/internal/scope/` writes `.agents/scope.lock` via `SafeAtomicWrite`.
2. `hooks/edit-scope-guard.sh` (registered as PreToolUse on `Edit|Write|Bash`) consults the lock on every subsequent tool call.
3. A worker that tries to `Write` to `skills/foo/SKILL.md` is rejected; a worker editing `cli/cmd/ao/scope.go` proceeds.

### Releasing scope at the end of a wave

**User says:** `$scope unfreeze`

**What happens:**

1. `ao scope unfreeze` rewrites `.agents/scope.lock` with `frozen_dirs: []`.
2. The hook short-circuits to exit 0 on the next tool call.

## Notes

- Wave 1 hardcodes the `.agents/scope.lock` path. Wave 2 (issue I5) migrates the path through `lib/ao-paths.sh`.
- The hook's defensive parse on malformed JSON is intentional. See [references/lock-file-format.md](references/lock-file-format.md) for the rationale.
- This skill is purely session-boundary (path-scope freezing within a session). Cron-cadence orchestration lives outside AgentOps on the orchestration substrate (the reference is NTM + MCP + managed-agents), not in an AgentOps-shipped daemon.
- Path-scope freezing handles *where* edits land. For a complementary lane that gates *what* commands run (`rm -rf`, `git reset --hard`, `DROP DATABASE`, `kubectl delete`, `terraform destroy`) — including allowlist layering, one-shot override codes, and PreToolUse wiring — see [references/destructive-command-guard-patterns.md](references/destructive-command-guard-patterns.md). Wire it alongside the scope guard when a wave touches infrastructure or shared data.
- When a workflow needs human approval, hook parity, or simultaneous command review rather than only path freezing, use [references/command-approval-and-hook-guardrails.md](references/command-approval-and-hook-guardrails.md).
- When authoring new hook behavior rather than using scope's existing guard, use the hook authoring guidance in `cc-hooks`.
