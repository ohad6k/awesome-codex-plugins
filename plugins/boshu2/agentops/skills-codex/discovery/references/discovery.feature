Feature: Discovery hands dense intent to planning
  As the front of the loop
  I want research and design densified and handed cleanly to Plan
  So that planning receives artifact links + density fields, not re-derived prose

  Scenario: Discovery delegates to Plan
    Given Discovery has a goal, research path, and design or brainstorm evidence
    When it crosses the `plan_slices` port
    Then it sends density fields and artifact links
    And it does not inline the Plan decomposition in Discovery prose

  Scenario: Discovery produces a durable execution packet
    When the discovery DAG completes
    Then it writes a JSON execution packet on disk for the next loop phase
    And the packet carries the goal, research, and design artifact references

  Scenario: Discovery admits one exact-plan Premortem verdict
    Given Plan has frozen the final plan path and digest
    When one fresh-context judge reviews it
    Then the verdict is PASS or FAIL and binds the live plan SHA-256
    And the author and judge identities differ
    And Discovery creates no alternate approval or retry state

  Scenario: Between-wave discovery requires an orchestrator request
    Given Learn emitted a cited material_change plan impact
    When the orchestrator requests a re-plan
    Then Discovery changes only the remaining plan
    And the changed plan returns to the orchestrator for Premortem

  # Gherkin acceptance is emitted by default — the operator never hand-specifies BDD (ag-9jle.2).
  Scenario: Discovery requires every planned bead to carry Gherkin scenarios by default
    Given Discovery crosses the plan_slices port to /plan
    When /plan returns beads at STEP 4
    Then every bead carries an embedded ## Scenarios (Given/When/Then) block
    And Discovery sends any bead with free-text-only acceptance back to /plan before compiling the packet

  # The load-bearing completion gate (age-ca5y): a plan document + a passing pre-mortem is NOT discovery-done.
  Scenario: Discovery is not DONE until the plan is persisted in the active tracker
    Given a specific-goal discovery run that wrote a plan markdown and passed pre-mortem
    But the epic and its vertical slices were never persisted to the tracker
    Then the run is NOT DONE and must operationalize the plan (epic + vertical slices, Gherkin acceptance, deps) first
    And the DONE gate verifies the packet's epic_id RESOLVES in the active tracker — br or bd, or the tasklist fallback
    And an epic persisted WITHOUT slice children is ALSO not DONE (the gate requires >=1 parent-child slice, not just the epic)
    And tasklist mode is not a silent pass — it fails closed unless the persisted .agents/rpi/tasklist.md (epic + slices) exists
    And this completion requirement applies on the default specific-goal path, not only the open-ended/--ideate path

  # Open-ended path — generate-winnow → operationalize → refine (ag-yw0).
  # Additive to the default flow above; strict delegation is preserved.
  # Documentation-only spec (this file is allowlisted in
  # scripts/.scenario-linkage-allow); wiring is asserted by the bats regression
  # test tests/scripts/brainstorm-discovery-ideation.bats.

  Scenario: an open-ended goal takes the generate-winnow path
    Given an open-ended goal like "improve the project" or the --ideate flag
    When /discovery runs
    Then it delegates to /brainstorm in ideation mode as a separate skill invocation
    And it does not inline the 30-idea generation in Discovery prose
    And the default specific-goal flow remains unchanged

  Scenario: Discovery operationalizes the winnowed portfolio into self-documenting beads
    Given a ranked portfolio of 15 ideas from ideation mode
    When the operationalize step runs
    Then it creates self-documenting br beads with dependency structure and explicit test tasks
    And each bead carries what, why, how, risks, and success criteria
    And it uses br for tracking and bv for graph triage

  Scenario: Discovery refines beads in plan space before crank
    Given operationalized beads exist
    When the refine step runs
    Then it makes one complete refinement pass and a second only after material graph change
    And it does not oversimplify or lose features or functionality
    And it validates no dependency cycles before handing the packet to /crank

  Scenario: Discovery shapes one bounded proof tranche
    Given aggregate demand contains more than three low-risk waves
    When Discovery compiles the execution packet
    Then the active tranche contains at most three sequential waves
    And remaining aggregate demand stays outside active WIP
    And the packet requires one final Validate and Learn transaction
