# Phase Data Contracts

How each consolidated phase passes data to the next. Artifacts are filesystem-based; no in-memory coupling between phases.

| Transition | Output | Extraction | Input to Next |
|------------|--------|------------|---------------|
| → Discovery | Goal string + repo execution profile contract | Goal from the `/rpi` invocation; repo policy from `docs/contracts/repo-execution-profile.md`, `repo-execution-profile.schema.json`, and `repo-execution-profile.json` when present | `repo_profile` state is loaded before research/planning begins, including validation lane mutation metadata |
| Discovery → Implementation | Dense execution packet + discovery summary | `.agents/rpi/phase-1-summary-*.md` + `.agents/rpi/execution-packet.json` (latest alias) or `.agents/rpi/runs/<run-id>/execution-packet.json` (run archive). Child outputs cross only as artifact paths. | `/crank <epic-id>` when `epic_id` exists; otherwise `/crank .agents/rpi/execution-packet.json` with density fields, repo policy, criteria, validation bundle, and `validation_lanes` already normalized |
| Implementation → Validation | Completed/partial crank status + implementation summary + `execution_packet` | `br children <epic-id>` or file-backed implementation state + `.agents/rpi/phase-2-summary.md` + `.agents/rpi/execution-packet.json` (latest alias) or `.agents/rpi/runs/<run-id>/execution-packet.json` (run archive) | `/validate <epic-id>` when `epic_id` exists; otherwise standalone `/validate` with the same repo execution profile fields, validation lanes, and done criteria |
| Validation → Learn | Immutable verdict + structured observations | `.agents/rpi/phase-3-summary.md` plus the verdict artifact | Learn binds the verdict digest and emits `remaining_work` plus `plan_impact` |
| Learn → Orchestrator | `material_change`, `no_change`, or `terminal` plan impact | `.agents/rpi/phase-4-summary.md` plus the Learn receipt | Only an explicit orchestrator re-plan request may return to Discovery; only an orchestrator-owned changed plan may then enter Premortem |

Discovery writes an honest prospective packet. Set `packet_state` to
`prospective`; record Discovery as `DONE` with the real phase-1 artifact, Crank
as `pending`, and Validate/Learn as `not_checked`, with no artifact field on an
unrun phase. A prospective packet must never fabricate terminal phase success.
RPI changes `packet_state` to `terminal` only when all four successful receipts
and their nonempty artifacts exist.
At the prospective boundary, `skills_loaded` lists only RPI and Discovery, the
contexts that actually ran. Pending Crank and not-checked Validate/Learn are
receipt placeholders, not fabricated skill-load evidence.

Execution packet v1 should remain additive. Recommended fields:
- `schema_version`
- `packet_state` (`prospective` at Discovery handoff; `terminal` only after Learn)
- `run_id`
- `objective`
- `density.intent`
- `density.boundary`
- `density.evidence`
- `density.decision`
- `density.constraint`
- `density.next_action`
- `artifacts.research_path`
- `artifacts.plan_path`
- `artifacts.premortem_path`
- `epic_id` (optional when the tracker cannot mint an epic)
- `plan_path`
- `contract_surfaces`
- `validation_commands`
- `validation_lanes` (repo profile lane metadata: `read_only`, `writes_artifacts`, `isolated_agents_home`, `release_only`, `mutation_escape_hatch`)
- `tracker_mode`
- `tracker_health`
- `done_criteria`
- `premortem_verdict`
- `test_levels`
- `ranked_packet_path`

Execution packet retention rule:
- `.agents/rpi/execution-packet.json` is the mutable latest alias for the current objective
- `.agents/rpi/runs/<run-id>/execution-packet.json` is the durable per-run packet archive when `run_id` exists

Validation lane selection rule:
- implementation and fast closeout phases prefer lanes where `read_only=true`, `writes_artifacts=false`, `release_only=false`, `cost_class` is `cheap` or `standard`, and `auto_select` is `default` or matches the changed surface
- lanes with `cost_class=expensive`, `auto_select=explicit`, or `auto_select=release-only` require an explicit operator request, a named plan acceptance criterion, or a release-readiness objective
- every selected lane should honor `timeout_seconds`; when a lane times out, record `[TIME-BOXED]` and continue with narrower evidence unless it was the only code-surface proof
- lanes with `isolated_agents_home=true` require isolated agent state before execution
- lanes with `writes_artifacts=true` or `release_only=true` are release/audit lanes; run them only when the packet objective or operator explicitly asks for release readiness
- lanes with a non-null `mutation_escape_hatch` require the escape hatch name in the validation report or handoff
- unclassified commands containing `go test -race`, `-shuffle`, `-count=N` where `N > 1`, eval runners, retrieval bench, headless runtime smoke, or release gates are explicit-only

Queue lifecycle rule:
- postmortem writes new entries as available: entry aggregate `consumed=false`, `claim_status="available"`
- consumers treat item lifecycle as authoritative inside `items[]`; omitted item `claim_status` means available
- `/evolve` and `/rpi loop` claim an item before starting a cycle: item `claim_status="in_progress"`
- successful `/rpi` + regression gate finalizes that item claim: item `consumed=true`, `claim_status="consumed"`, `consumed_by`, `consumed_at`
- failed or regressed cycles release the claim back to available state and may stamp item `failed_at` for retry ordering
- consumers may rewrite existing queue lines to claim, release, fail, or consume items after initial write
- the entry aggregate flips to `consumed=true` only after every child item is consumed

## Rollback discipline

When changing phase-boundary logic, ship phase-3 (closeout) updates FIRST and remove phase-2 (handoff) logic SECOND. This keeps a working closeout path in place during the transition window — if phase-3 ships broken, you can revert before phase-2's removal lands.

Premortem F3 of `soc-bcrn` (`.agents/council/2026-05-07-pre-mortem-rpi-lifecycle-sharpening.md`) called this out as the primary rollback risk for the consolidated daemon epic (E3).

Worked example: `cli/cmd/ao/rpi_cleanup.go:preserveWorktreeCommits` (phase-3 commit-preservation logic) was added BEFORE the phase-2 cleanup-removal as part of E3.S3. The order matters: orphaned worktree commits that previously fell into git fsck dangling now land on `codex/preserve-<runID>` branches before the worktree is force-removed. If preservation had been wired in the opposite order, a regression window would have lost commits during the transition.
