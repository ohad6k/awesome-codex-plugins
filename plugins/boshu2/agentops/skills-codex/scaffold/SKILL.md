# Scaffold

Create one bounded project, component, or CI scaffold. This specialist does not
schedule RPI, create work ownership, mutate Git, or decide what happens next.

## Contract

1. Resolve the requested target root and declare the exact paths that may be
   created or changed.
2. Refuse to overwrite an existing path without explicit caller authorization.
3. Generate idiomatic, functional files with at least one behavioral test for
   generated behavior.
4. Run the target's selected build, test, and lint commands once.
5. Report the files changed and factual command results, then stop.

Use the current agent and local shell unless the caller explicitly requests a
different runtime. Preserve unrelated existing changes.

## Modes

- `$scaffold <language> <name>` creates a project.
- `$scaffold component <type> <name>` adds a component to an existing project.
- `$scaffold ci <platform>` creates the requested CI configuration.

If the request does not identify a target or language, ask only for the missing
fact. The caller owns version control, revision, and delivery.

## Evidence

Return:

- the target root and actual changed paths;
- the build, test, and lint commands selected;
- each command's exit code;
- any requested check that was not run.

The result contains no verdict, lifecycle state, retry instruction, or next
action.
