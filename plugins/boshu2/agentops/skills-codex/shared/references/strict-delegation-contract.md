# Strict Delegation Contract (shared)

> Applies to all top-level orchestrator skills: `/rpi`, `/discovery`, `/validate`.
> Strict sub-skill delegation is the **default**, not opt-in.

This source reference is canonical. Runtime twins must be generated from it;
receipt semantics never originate in a projection-only copy.

## The Contract

Top-level orchestrator skills delegate to their declared sub-skills via `Skill(skill="<name>", ...)` — **as separate tool invocations**, one per phase/step. Each sub-skill owns its artifact, its gate, and its retry policy. Inlining the work breaks that ownership chain.

There is no `--full` flag because strict delegation is always on.

## Phase-Isolated Transport

Strict delegation names the contract. Transport isolation names where that
contract runs.

For high-cost lifecycle phases, the desired runtime shape is:

1. The visible orchestrator keeps the lifecycle objective, phase order, and
   retry policy.
2. A phase runner receives only the phase skill name, the bounded handoff
   artifact, and the minimum objective context.
3. The runner executes the declared skill contract (`/discovery`, `/crank`, or
   `/validate`) in an isolated phase context.
4. The orchestrator receives only artifact path, verdict, and next action.

This is not a compression escape. It is strict delegation over an isolated
transport. The forbidden move is replacing the skill contract with direct agent
work.

## Anti-Pattern: Compression

Do not inline phase work, compress multiple phases into one pass, substitute
direct `Agent()` work for a skill contract, or skip mandatory phases. Typical
rationalizations to reject:

- *"I'll compress the three phases into one pass."*
- *"Let me do discovery inline — I already know what to do."*
- *"Nested `Skill()` calls waste context; I'll spawn an `Agent()` instead."*
- *"The implementation is validated by tests passing; skipping `/validate`."*
- *"The plan looks good, skipping pre-mortem to save time."*
- *"I'll just spawn 3 judges directly — it's what `/validate` does anyway."*
- *"Post-mortem is just writing a summary, I'll do it inline."*

### Pre-Mortem Anti-Rationalization Clause

The following do **NOT** count as a pre-mortem and **MUST NOT** be used to skip
the delegated `/pre-mortem` pass:

1. **An inline risk or "honest risk" section the author wrote.** The author's
   own risk assessment is autocorrelated with the plan — the same blind spots
   that shaped the plan shape the risk section. It is not an independent check.
2. **An earlier adversarial pass on an INPUT or premise, not THIS plan.** A
   prior council/siege/refutation that challenged a *premise* (e.g. "is this
   the right goal?") does not validate the *implementation plan* derived from
   that premise. Different artifact, different failure modes.
3. **"A related council already ran."** A council on a sibling plan, a prior
   version of the plan, or a different artifact in the same epic does not
   transfer. Pre-mortem is plan-specific.

**Pre-mortem = DELEGATED + INDEPENDENT (author ≠ reviewer) + fresh-context on
THIS plan.** All three conditions must hold. An inline section satisfies none;
a prior-premise adversarial pass satisfies at most one (independent) but not
the other two (not this plan, not delegated).

All of these are contract violations. A live compression was observed 2026-04-19 (see [`docs/learnings/orchestrator-compression-anti-pattern.md`](../../../docs/learnings/orchestrator-compression-anti-pattern.md)). The compression "worked" mechanically (strict build passed, 2-judge inline vibe PASSed) but the knowledge flywheel never turned — no forged learnings, no post-mortem artifact, no structured council verdict. Contract strength depends on actual `Skill()` invocations, not self-certification.

## `Agent()` vs `Skill()`

These are **not interchangeable**:

| Call | When to use |
|------|-------------|
| `Skill(skill="<name>", ...)` | Invoking a declared skill with its full contract. Required for phase delegation. |
| `Agent(subagent_type="...", ...)` | Spawning a sub-agent for parallel independent work **within a skill's step** (e.g., `/research` dispatching parallel Explore agents is fine). |
| Phase runner | Runtime transport that executes one declared skill contract in an isolated context and returns only the bounded phase artifact. |

If you're tempted to call `Agent()` in place of a `Skill()` invocation, you're compressing. Stop.

If a runtime lacks a native `Skill()`-fork boundary, a phase runner may use a
subagent, daemon job, or process wrapper as transport. That wrapper must be
thin: load the declared skill, execute the skill workflow, write the expected
artifact, and return a compact result. It must not perform the phase directly.

## Supported Compression Escapes

These flags scale *gate depth* or *scope*, **never skip phases**. They are the only supported shortcuts:

### `/rpi`
- `--quick` / `--fast-path` — force fast complexity (inline `--quick` gates inside sub-skills; still runs all three phases)
- `--from=<phase>` — resume from a specific phase when earlier artifacts already exist
- `--skip-pre-mortem` / `--no-retro` / `--no-forge` — skip specific sub-skills inside a phase
- `--no-budget` — disable phase time budgets

### `/discovery`
- `--quick` — passed through to `/pre-mortem` for fast inline gate
- `--skip-brainstorm` — skip STEP 1 when the goal is specific (>50 chars, no vague keywords)
- `--interactive` / `--auto` — control human-gate behavior in research and plan
- `--no-scaffold` — skip STEP 4.5 scaffold auto-invocation (canonical name; `--no-lifecycle` is a deprecated alias through v2.40.0)

### `/validate`
- `--quick` — fast inline gates inside sub-skills (vibe, post-mortem)
- `--no-retro` / `--no-forge` — skip specific sub-skills
- `--no-lifecycle` — skip STEP 1.7 lifecycle checks (test, deps, review, perf)
- `--no-behavioral` — skip STEP 1.8 holdout scenarios
- `--allow-critical-deps` — allow shipping despite CVSS ≥ 9.0 findings

**If tempted to shortcut outside this list: stop and delegate.**

## Positive Pattern: What Correct Delegation Looks Like

A correct `/rpi` invocation shows three distinct `Skill()` tool calls at phase boundaries:

```
Skill(skill="discovery", args="<goal> --auto")      # Phase 1
  → <promise>DONE</promise>
  → reads .agents/rpi/execution-packet.json
Skill(skill="crank", args="<packet-path> [--test-first]")   # Phase 2
  → <promise>DONE</promise>
  → reads .agents/rpi/phase-2-summary-*.md
Skill(skill="validate", args="--complexity=<level> [--strict-surfaces]")   # Phase 3
  → <promise>DONE</promise>
  → writes .agents/rpi/phase-3-summary-*.md
```

Anything less is compressed.

When phase-isolated transport is available, the transcript may show a phase
runner instead of raw inline skill execution. The acceptance rule is still the
same: the delegated phase contract must run, emit its completion marker, and
write the expected phase summary file.

The phase artifact should also carry a `## Skill Receipts` section, and the
execution packet should carry cumulative `skills_loaded` / `phase_receipts`
entries. These receipts are not a substitute for delegated invocation evidence;
they are the disk-backed audit index that lets later validation detect a missing
phase after chat or runtime traces are unavailable.

## Detection for Reviewers

When auditing a session that claims to have run `/rpi`, check the transcript for:

1. **Three delegated phase contracts** at phase boundaries (`Skill()` directly,
   or a phase runner whose sole job is to execute the named skill contract).
2. **Three `<promise>DONE</promise>` markers**, each from the delegated sub-skill.
3. **Three phase summary files** in `.agents/rpi/phase-{1,2,3}-summary-*.md`.
4. **Phase artifact receipts** in the execution packet or phase summaries:
   `skills_loaded` names the orchestrator and phase skill, and
   `phase_receipts` names phase, skill, status/verdict, and artifact path.

Missing any of items 1-3 = compression. Missing item 4 = an unauditable handoff
gap; treat it as non-compliant until the artifact is corrected or runtime trace
evidence is attached.

## Enforcement Layers (defense in depth)

1. **This contract document** — read before / during orchestrator invocation.
2. **Loud text in each orchestrator's SKILL.md** — anti-pattern section with explicit examples.
3. **Durable learning** at `docs/learnings/orchestrator-compression-anti-pattern.md` — surfaced through the orchestrator skill contracts.
4. **Phase artifact receipts** — file-backed `skills_loaded` / `phase_receipts`
   records that validation and review can inspect without relying on memory.
5. **Optional future**: runtime hook that inspects the skill invocation trace,
   cross-checks it against phase receipts, and blocks downstream work when
   phases were skipped. Not implemented; deferred to a follow-up initiative.

Contract strength alone is not enforcement. Layer 1 (this doc) + Layer 2
(SKILL.md sections) + Layer 3 (flywheel injection) + Layer 4 (artifact receipts)
together give durable coverage.
