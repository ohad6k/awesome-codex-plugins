# Doc Skill

**YOU MUST EXECUTE THIS WORKFLOW. Do not just describe it.**

Generate and validate documentation for any project. `--mode` selects the artifact family — the default mode handles code/API docs and code-maps; `--mode=readme` generates a gold-standard README; `--mode=oss` scaffolds and audits the open-source doc pack.

## Constraints

- Ground every documentation claim in the current repository, because plausible but stale prose is a documentation defect.
- In OSS scaffold mode, create missing docs only by default; never update or overwrite an existing doc unless the user explicitly confirms, because these files may contain operator-owned policy and project history. Treat `refresh` as a separate opt-in path and confirm its target writes with the user before proceeding.
- Keep mode boundaries explicit and run the selected mode's validation, because default, README, and OSS outputs have different completion criteria.

## Modes

| `--mode` | Artifact | Read first |
|----------|----------|-----------|
| *(default)* | API docs, code-maps, doc coverage/validate | this file |
| `readme` | Gold-standard README (interview → generate → council-validate) | [references/readme-craft.md](references/readme-craft.md) |
| `oss` | OSS doc pack (CONTRIBUTING/CHANGELOG/AGENTS.md, audit + scaffold) | [references/oss-pack.md](references/oss-pack.md) |

**Mode routing (absorbed skills):**

| You typed | Runs |
|-----------|------|
| "readme", "rewrite the README", "validate the README" | `$doc --mode=readme [...]` |
| "oss docs", "scaffold contributing", "audit OSS docs" | `$doc --mode=oss [...]` |

When invoked with `--mode=readme` or `--mode=oss`, read the corresponding reference above and follow its workflow verbatim. The default-mode steps below apply only when no mode (or the implied code-docs mode) is selected.

## Execution Steps (default mode — code/API docs)

Default mode is deliberately thin — a frontier model runs it correctly with no payload. Given `$doc [command] [target]`:

1. **Detect project type** — `ls package.json pyproject.toml go.mod Cargo.toml` + existing `docs/`; classify CODING / INFORMATIONAL / OPS.
2. **Run the command** — `discover` (grep undocumented funcs), `coverage` (documented vs total), `gen [feature]` (read code → stamp function/class markdown), `all`, or `validate`.
3. **Write the report** to `.agents/doc/YYYY-MM-DD-<target>.md` (coverage %, generated, gaps, validation issues), then report coverage + gaps to the user.

Full step-by-step detail — grep recipes, function/class + code-map templates, the report skeleton, key rules, worked examples, and the troubleshooting table — lives in **[references/default-mode.md](references/default-mode.md)** (moved there in the generic-craft trim). Read it when you need the exact shapes; otherwise just do the three steps.

## Output Specification

- **Path:** default-mode reports go to the artifact directory `.agents/doc/`; README mode updates the repository `README.md`; OSS scaffold mode creates missing root documentation only by default. The separate OSS `refresh` path may update an existing doc only after explicit user confirmation.
- **Filename:** default reports use the filename convention `YYYY-MM-DD-<target>.md`; README and OSS filenames follow their mode references.
- **Format:** outputs are Markdown; the default report schema records coverage percentage, generated artifacts, gaps, and validation issues.
- **Validation command:** validate the skill contract with `bash skills/doc/scripts/validate.sh`, then run the mode-specific validation required by its reference before reporting completion.
- **Downstream handoff:** return changed paths, validation results, coverage or remaining gaps, and any blocked decision; these results are consumed by the requesting workflow and the verification membrane.

## Quality Checklist

- Every factual claim is traceable to inspected code, configuration, or existing documentation.
- Generated documentation follows the selected mode's templates and preserves useful existing depth.
- Completion reports name the validators run and disclose unresolved gaps rather than implying full coverage.

## Examples

```bash
$doc                    # default: docs for the changed surface (references/default-mode.md)
$doc --mode=readme      # gold-standard README, council-validated
$doc --mode=oss         # full OSS doc pack
```

## Troubleshooting

| Problem | Fix |
|---------|-----|
| Default mode feels heavyweight | Read [references/default-mode.md](references/default-mode.md) — or just ask the model directly for simple docs |
| README mode verdict fails | Re-run with the council findings addressed (see the readme-mode references listed above) |
