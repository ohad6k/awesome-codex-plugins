# RCH — remote compilation specialist

RCH can offload one explicit compilation command or inspect the remote compiler
path. This skill reports what happened; it does not govern retries or repair.

## Procedure

1. Capture `rch check`, `rch doctor --json`, worker status, and the relevant
   `[RCH]` summary before mutation.
2. For diagnosis, identify the first failing stage: availability, configuration,
   hook, classification, sync, remote compile, or worker pressure.
3. Run only the caller-authorized command or documented safe diagnostic once.
4. Capture the exact command, worker when known, exit code, local-fallback reason,
   and post-action status.
5. Stop and return the evidence.

`[RCH] local (...)` means the requested remote-offload claim was not proved even
when the local build succeeds. Destructive cleanup, worker deployment, daemon
configuration, and remote mutation require explicit caller authority.

## Output

Return a factual packet with status (`remote`, `local_fallback`, `failed`, or
`not_proven`), commands and exit codes, worker, summary line, and checked/not
checked surfaces. Do not include a next action.
