# /ship-loop anti-patterns

Nine observed patterns to avoid when shipping in the bot-paired fast lane.

## 1. Shipping an inventory-touching PR without the regen sweep

**Pattern:** A PR adds a new skill, new contract file, new schema, or any inventory artifact. Operator pushes without running the regen sweep (sync-skill-counts, codex-hashes, domain-map, context-map, registry, sync-hooks). CI then fires ~15 inventory validators and 5+ of them fail.

**Why it costs:** Each CI failure becomes a cycle of (read failure → fix → push → wait 5-10 min for CI → next failure surfaces). 15 fixes through CI re-runs is ~60-90 minutes of operator attention. The same 15 fixes via the regen sweep at write-time is seconds.

**Rule:** Use `scripts/ship.sh` (mechanical regen sweep) for any PR that adds:
- A new skill (touches `skills/`, `skills-codex/`, `SKILL-TIERS.md`, `skill-dispositions.yaml`, `registry.json`, manifest, marker, catalog, etc.)
- A new contract (`docs/contracts/*.md` or `*.yaml`)
- A new schema (`schemas/*.json`)
- Any docs that get auto-indexed (`docs/learnings/`, `docs/architecture/`)

`ship.sh` detects these surfaces and runs the regen sweep preemptively — it removes the operator's choice to skip the rule (mechanical enforcement). For non-inventory PRs (single-file logic change, doc typo, dependency bump), skip `ship.sh` and just push; routine release authority is the local cockpit/pre-push proof path, with CI as PR/tag/manual backstop telemetry.

**Evidence:** PR #332 (`soc-b0nn`, this skill's own first PR) hit 15 distinct registries-drift failures on CI. Each was mechanical, but the sequential discovery turned a 30-min PR into a 90-min PR. **The skill that codifies the discipline burned the discipline learning the lesson.** Mechanically fixed by `scripts/ship.sh` (soc-33uy, PR #346).

## 2. Bundling pre-existing fixes

**Pattern:** Pre-push surfaces a WARN/FAIL in content you didn't change. Tempting to fix it inline since you're already there.

**Why it costs:** Other concurrent branches will hit the same pre-existing issue and apply the same fix inline. Result: 3 PRs each fixing the same line; the latter two are merge-conflict cleanup.

**Rule:** File the side-quest fix as its OWN atomic PR. Push it. Let it merge. Rebase your feature branch onto fresh main. Then continue your feature work.

**Evidence:** 2026-05-18 session — `../../AGENTS.md` broken link from PR #306 was fixed inline in PRs #322, #324, #325 before settling. Tracked as failure-mode F2.

## 3. Keeping copied variables after a rewrite

**Pattern:** Rewriting a script as a thin wrapper. The new code doesn't use `REPO_ROOT` / `TMP_DIR` / etc., but the rewrite preserves the old variable declarations "to be safe".

**Why it costs:** shellcheck SC2034 fires on the very next pre-push gate, requiring a cleanup PR.

**Rule:** After any script rewrite, the FIRST self-check is "are all top-level variable declarations referenced in the new body?" Run `shellcheck <path>` before commit, not after.

**Evidence:** PR #322 (`soc-3oij`) left `REPO_ROOT` unused; PR #325 cleaned it up. Tracked as failure-mode F1; mechanically closed by PR #326 (unconditional shellcheck on staged `.sh`).

## 4. Asserting local-only state in CI tests

**Pattern:** Writing a bats test that checks `[ -f .agents/learnings/<file>.md ]` to anchor the rationale.

**Why it costs:** `.agents/` is gitignored. The file does NOT exist in CI's fresh clone. The test fails in CI even though it passes locally.

**Rule:** Assert the rationale REFERENCE in the script body via `grep -q '<slug>' "$SCRIPT"`. Same intent (regression-guard the rationale link), doesn't depend on local state.

**Evidence:** Self-bug discovered mid-session on PR #326 + #329; both fixed in flight by replacing the file check with a grep on the script body.

## 5. Branches off out-of-date main

**Pattern:** Creating a feature branch when `git log main..HEAD` shows you're behind origin.

**Why it costs:** The branch needs `update-branch` immediately to catch up, and on multi-author repos the bot may attempt forward-ports of files it can't write (e.g., `.github/workflows/claude.yml`), entering a self-revert loop.

**Rule:** `git checkout main && git pull --rebase` BEFORE creating the feature branch. If `git pull --rebase` fails due to local stash/dirt, stash + retry.

**Evidence:** PR #270 sat 6 days because its branch was 195+ files behind main; the bot's claude.yml forward-port hit the `workflows: write` perm gate, the bot reverted its own merge, and `claude-review` stayed failing. Fixed by force-pushing a locally-rebased branch.

## 6. Skipping the failing-test-first step

**Pattern:** Writing the implementation first, then adding tests after — or worse, writing tests that pass after the implementation without ever having failed.

**Why it costs:** False confidence. A test that has never failed is not regression-guarding; it might assert the wrong thing entirely.

**Rule:** Per `.claude/rules/{go,python}.md`: L2-first/L1-always. Write the test that demonstrates the failure (reproduces SC2034, or the path-traversal, or the empty-Raw bug). Confirm it fails for the right reason. Then write the minimal fix that makes it green.

**Evidence:** PR #326's commit body explicitly reproduced SC2034 with a synthetic fixture before adding the fix. PR #324's tests covered 10 path-traversal subcases each rejected with `errors.Is(err, ErrInvalidRunID)`.

## 7. Claiming a gate fix lands without re-running the gate at post-merge HEAD

**Pattern:** A PR changes gate/validator/CI behavior. Operator ships it based on fast-gate green + diff-reading confidence, but never re-runs the targeted gate against the canonical post-merge state. Later discovery: the fix was ineffective and the gate still fails.

**Why it costs:** One self-correction PR per ineffective fix. Three self-corrections in a single session is real; the worst case is the operator declares success and walks away, leaving silent gate-drift on main until the next full-gate run discovers it.

**Rule:** For every PR that changes a gate, validator, or CI behavior:
1. Before opening the PR, run the affected gate locally and capture the targeted output line.
2. Include that line verbatim in the PR body as **Evidence**.
3. After merge, run the affected gate on the canonical HEAD and verify the output still matches the claim.
4. If it doesn't: file an atomic follow-up immediately; do NOT wait for someone else to notice.

**Falsifiable test:** if your PR claims "X is now skipped," then `grep "X.*skipped" <post-merge-gate-log>` must return a match.

**Mechanical enforcement (soc-o5kq + soc-eqjd):** `scripts/verify-gate-claim.sh <ref> "<claim>"` greps a gate log for the claim verbatim. The `validate-pr-evidence-claims` CI job in `.github/workflows/validate.yml` (soc-eqjd, PR #358) calls it automatically against every `Evidence:` line in the open PR body, against the workflow run's logs. A false claim now blocks the PR at CI time. (The original local pre-push wiring from soc-o5kq's check #39 was retired with the local gate itself; the CI job is the durable surface.)

**Evidence:** PR #350 (`soc-nmhp`) claimed eval-canaries were skipped on non-eval diffs; merged. Cycle 4 of `/evolve` re-ran the full gate on canonical post-merge HEAD and saw the same FAIL the fix was supposed to remove. Root cause: relied on `HAS_EVAL=1`, which is default-1 outside the `FAST_MODE` block (see anti-pattern #8 / learning `2026-05-19-default-true-flags-are-path-filter-footguns.md`). Shipped #352 as the actual fix. Tracked as the self-verify discipline in `2026-05-19-self-verify-before-claiming-fix-lands.md`. AP#7 became mechanical on 2026-05-19 — see `scripts/verify-gate-claim.sh` + `tests/scripts/verify-gate-claim.bats`.

## 8. Editing a gate/validator script without running its bats locally

**Pattern:** Operator changes a script under `scripts/` confident the diff is "obviously correct." Pushes. CI's `bats-tests` job fails because a regression test specifically guards the semantic the change broke.

**Why it costs:** A CI-roundtrip discovers what `bats tests/scripts/<file>.bats` would have caught in <60 seconds locally. The bats suite is the fast oracle for shell-config changes — running it costs nothing at write-time.

**Rule:** When editing any `scripts/*.sh` that has a matching bats suite under `tests/scripts/`:

```bash
bats tests/scripts/<name>.bats
```

Run BEFORE `git commit`. Fix any failures in the same commit. Treat the bats suite as the regression-guard contract for the script's documented semantics.

**Evidence (historical):** PR #352 (`soc-98o8`) first push removed an explicit fast-mode skip branch in the (now-retired) `scripts/pre-push-gate.sh` eval-canary trigger logic. A bats test in `tests/scripts/pre-push-gate.bats` ("skips eval canaries by default for eval changes in local fast mode") FAILed on CI. Local bats run would have caught it pre-push. Re-pushed with semantics preserved; all 55 tests then green. The lesson generalizes beyond pre-push-gate.sh: any gate/validator script with a sibling bats file gets the same treatment.

## 9. Closing a bead on push output alone under direct-push-to-main

**Pattern:** Under direct-push-to-main with concurrent lanes running, the operator runs `git push`, sees a success line, and closes the bead on that output alone.

**Why it costs:** `git push` success output lies about what actually landed. Another lane can win the race to the tip, so a bead closed on push output alone can be closed against a commit that never became reachable from `origin/main` — the tracker reads "done" while the work is not on main.

**Rule:** After push, prove the landing before closing the bead:
1. `git fetch origin`
2. `git merge-base --is-ancestor <landed-sha> origin/main` MUST pass (exit 0) — the deterministic proof the commit is reachable from the canonical tip.
3. Only then let the repository owner update its tracker using the repository's
   own policy. Delivery success is evidence for that decision, not lifecycle
   authority inside Crank.

**Evidence:** Seen live 2026-07-01 under parallel-lane churn on this repo's hot main — a `git push` reported success but the pushed tip lost the race and never became an ancestor of `origin/main`.

## When you've violated one of these

Don't hide it. Note it in the commit body — "this PR also includes an inline fix for the F2 pre-existing-blocker (see PR #X); should have been atomic, ate the cost this time." Naming it keeps the discipline honest.
