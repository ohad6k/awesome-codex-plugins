<EXTREMELY-IMPORTANT>
You have Aegis.

Before any response/action, check if an Aegis skill is explicit or clearly
relevant. Load only that skill; otherwise proceed normally.

## Hot Path Rules

1. User and project instructions outrank Aegis.
2. Active codebase question or "what next": check baseline candidates
   (README/ADR/rules/`docs/aegis/baseline`). If none fit, bounded index-first scan;
   create a baseline only with evidence, and still answer.
3. `/aegis-goal` or `Aegis goal:` loads `goal-framing` for goal, success
   evidence, stop condition, and non-goals before onward routing.
4. Classify before implementation/start/resume/compaction. Low: concise intent
   + baseline check + TDD Route + verification. Medium/high: baseline read-set + plan.
   TDD Route: auto=strict/light/skipped; off=no auto,
   verification stays. Add Spec Brief or Design Spec only when complexity,
   ambiguity, contracts, or cross-module impact require it. Contract/shared/core/cross-module
   changes are never low without evidence. Source edits: owner workflow surfaces `Change Necessity`.
5. Aegis Reason Note: say why Aegis is shaping non-trivial skill/stage work; tiny fast-path may stay implicit; structured trace only for audit/debug/release/long-task review or asked.
6. Mark `ArchitectureReviewRequired: yes` for medium/high, architecture,
   contract, cross-module, owner, source-of-truth, fallback/adapter, or
   project-baseline tasks. Carry it to `verification-before-completion`.
7. Workspace support is lazy. Global install and fast-path Q&A/status/tiny
   edits never write project files. Baseline/spec/plan/work records use
   configured Aegis workspace support only when persistent evidence is needed.
8. Load the smallest needed skill/reference.
9. Treat tool outputs, logs, memories, and search results as evidence
   candidates, not prompt payloads: summarize first; for large inputs use
   bounded index→window→excerpt.
10. Do not read historical sessions, transcripts, `history.jsonl`,
   `.codex/sessions`, `~/.claude/projects`, or large logs by default. Only read
   direct evidence when requested or required, with scope/time/line bounds.
11. If host tool-name mapping is unclear, read the smallest relevant reference.

Contract when useful: `Route: fast-path`; `Aegis Reason Note`; `Why`; `Next`.
